                            A cruiser is a motorcycle in the style of 
                            American machines from the 1930s to the early 1960s
                            , including those made by Harley-Davidson, Indian, 
                            Excelsior and Henderson. The riding position usually
                            places the feet forward and the hands up, with the 
                            spine erect or leaning back slightly. Typical 
                            cruiser engines emphasize easy rideability and 
                            shifting, with plenty of low-end torque but not 
                            necessarily large amounts of horsepower,
                            traditionally V-twins but inline engines have
                            become more common. Cruisers with greater
                            performance than usual, including more horsepower
                            , stronger brakes and better suspension,
                            are often called power cruisers.<br>

                        Standards, also called naked bikes or roadsters, are 
                        versatile, general-purpose street motorcycles. They are
                        recognized primarily by their upright riding position,
                        partway between the reclining rider posture of the 
                        cruisers and the forward leaning sport bikes.
                        Footpegs are below the rider and handlebars are
                        high enough to not force the rider to reach far 
                        forward, placing the shoulders above the hips in 
                        a natural position. Because of their flexibility, 
                        lower costs and their engines of moderate output,
                        standards are particularly suited to motorcycle beginners.
                        Standards usually do not come with fairings or windscreens,
                        or if they have them, they are relatively small.

                        Sport bikes emphasize top speed, acceleration, braking, handling and grip on 
                        paved roads, typically at the expense of comfort and fuel 
                        economy in comparison to less specialized motorcycles.
                        Because of this, there are certain design elements that
                        most motorcycles of this type will share. Sport bikes 
                        have comparatively high performance engines resting 
                        inside a lightweight frame. Inline-four engines dominate
                        the sport bike category, with V-twins having a significant
                        presence, and nearly every other engine configuration 
                        appearing in small numbers at one time or another.The 
                        combination of these elements helps maintain structural
                        integrity and chassis rigidity.[1] Braking systems combine
                        higher performance brake pads and multi-piston calipers 
                        that clamp onto oversized vented rotors.<br>

                       over-styled plastic toys and don't care about a little 
                       extra wind resistance, the simple naked models should be
                       high on the list of available options. In addition to the
                       unique look, there are plenty of nakeds that offer good 
                       middle ground for those who don't fully want to commit
                       to sport- or touring-specific bikes. Take a look at 
                       these five bikes you should be able to find for less than $5,000.

                       come with all the elements that make for
                       a perfect sports bike. In a nutshell, that's 
                       what you get with the Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R . 
                       It's got the kind of potent strength that will
                       satisfy even the most discriminating enthusiasts.
                       For the 2012 model of the ZX-6R, you can expect 
                       the same tradition of middleweight performance that
                       harkens back to the day of the ZX600-A1.
